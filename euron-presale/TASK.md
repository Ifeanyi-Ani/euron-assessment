# Euron Presale Backend Assessment  

Welcome to the Euron take-home assessment! This assessment is designed to evaluate your skills in backend development, particularly using Rust and blockchain-related technologies.  

## Task Overview  

Your task is to enhance the backend of the Euron Presale system. This includes optimizing smart contract interactions, improving system reliability, and handling presale logic efficiently. Below are the detailed requirements.  

---

## Requirements  

### 1. **Presale Logic Enhancements**  
- Implement a backend service that interacts with the provided smart contract to handle presale contributions.  
- Add the following features:
  - Verify wallet contributions based on address and amount.  
  - Enforce presale limits (minimum and maximum contribution per wallet).  
  - Provide real-time updates for the total funds raised during the presale.  

### 2. **Smart Contract Interaction**  
- Use Rust to create APIs that interact with the provided Solidity smart contract.  
- Functions to implement:
  - `contribute(wallet_address: String, amount: u64)`  
  - `get_total_contributions() -> u64`  
  - `get_contributions_by_wallet(wallet_address: String) -> u64`  

### 3. **Performance Optimization**  
- Ensure the API is highly performant, even with high traffic.  
- Implement caching for frequently requested data, such as the total contributions.  

### 4. **Error Handling**  
- Implement robust error handling for common issues, such as:  
  - Invalid wallet addresses.  
  - Insufficient gas or failed transactions.  
  - Smart contract call timeouts.

## Deliverables  

1. A Rust-based backend service that fulfills the requirements listed above.  
2. Clear and concise documentation for the code, including how to run the backend service.  
3. Test cases to verify the correctness of the implemented functionality.  
4. A brief write-up (in Markdown or a plain text file) explaining your approach, any challenges faced, and how you addressed them.

## Environment Setup  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://hiring1@bitbucket.org/euronio/euron-presale.git  
   ```  
2. Install the necessary tools:  
   - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)  
   - [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)  
   - Any additional dependencies required for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts (e.g., `ethers-rs`).  

3. Compile the smart contract and deploy it to a testnet (e.g., Goerli or Sepolia). Use tools like Hardhat for this step.  

---

## Evaluation Criteria  

1. **Correctness**: Does the backend meet the requirements?  
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, modular, and well-documented?  
3. **Performance**: Is the solution efficient and performant?  
4. **Security**: Are best practices followed to ensure safe interactions with the smart contract?  
5. **Testing**: Are there comprehensive tests to validate the implementation?

## Submission  

- Once completed, submit your work as follows:  
  1. Create a private repository on your preferred version control platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).  
  2. Invite `euron-hiring` (or a similar account) to review the repository.  
  3. Alternatively, email a zip file of your project via email

Please include a brief write-up with your submission.
